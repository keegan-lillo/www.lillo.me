The resulting data was then combined to formulate the final score and generate a unique, sharable graphic for the user.</p>",

Being lead on this project meant that I was able to ensure the infrastructure and presentation layer worked harmoniously. One example of this is that there was not a single Facebook API call made by our server infrastructure. Everything was performed client side. This resulted in a highly available and scalable final product.</p>",
